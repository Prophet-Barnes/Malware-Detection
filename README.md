# Malware Detection
The project deals with performing EDA and using Supervised Machine Learning models to classify whether a program is benign or malicious.
Joblib dumps (files with the names of ML models) were created for every ML model used in the project.

The dataset used was: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dphi-official/Datasets/master/clamp/train_set_label.csv
